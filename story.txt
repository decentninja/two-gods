"You know what? Let me make you a bet."

Two gods stroll over gravel between ponds. The gnome's eyes glimmer at the square-eyed goddess of relaxation.

"I'll down 2 Jimjars cocktails (50-50 chance of making you super drunk or tasting good) if you can name all of the characters in these scenes, and if you fail, you'll do it instead.".

The girl in nightwear nods: "Oh, it's on! And whoever listens in to this conversion, why don't you join us by recording how many you can remember?".

The two titans laugh at the premise and stop in front of one of the ponds. As the water calms down, their reflections are replaced by imagery.

Dark clouds billow out of a strange structure on top of a rock formation. A collection of houses, a temple, and a lighthouse all smashed together in the most inconvenient place. The lighthouse pierces though the starry night as a fight like no other takes place on top of it. 3 flying theiflings and a half-elf with red knee-high boots launch spells, into their former home as the defendants fire back with slurs and arrows. A fireball is counterspelled, then the counterspell is counterspelled resulting in a grand explosion that blows out all of the windows. The first theifling carries a mace, the second a flag-spear, the third a mobile organ. The half-elf carries a harp and a flute.

The girl yawns, "Easy, that's [Afterburn], [Standard], [Crescendo] and [Anthem aka Miki]. If you don't step it up I'm gonna have to take over!".

"Oh, don't you worry, you will be challenged." the gnome answers.

The two continues to another pond.

The view of this pond sweeps down into a mountain tunnel, that opens up to a hangar. A spiral staircase in the middle of the hall without railing goes from the floor to the ceiling. Water pathways encircle the round harbor and 2 massive galleys lay docked to ancient temple pillars. In a drydock a third galleon seems to undergo a redesign, its hull interior exposed. Two openings in the rough mountain walls continue into the mountain. A goblin in a lab coat, who has yet to realize his hat is gone is guiding a group of adventurers through the cave, showing off the mighty SS Wrath that he's been working on. Just as he steps from the drydock on to the deck of the ship, someone in the shadows disables the mechanism holding the ship in place. The ship is launched into the river, breaking into two pieces as it hits the water, killing the poor goblin. A giant snail, with spiky tendrils and shining shell, coughs up his tea.

"Aaa, good one! This requires more than name recognition! But still, too easy. [Hank] is the name of the goblin. [Angus] is the flail snail. The saboteur is non-other than [Greedy Kira]. My turn, follow me." The girl answers.

The girl leads leave the gravel route and continues down another path. As they continue and they spot the next pond. 

The gnome exclaims "Oh, that's obscure!"

Situated in a forest, just under a lake and surrounded by a wooden palisade is a town engulfed in fog. Planted in the ground outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them. Deep in the town, there's a house that seems disgusted with itself. Its slouching roof, dead garden and moss-covered walls. The housemaid has a black eye and is locked in a wardrobe. Her weak appearance and faint voice will never get her out of there alone.

"Ha, one of my favorites, the maid is Jonata." the gnome sais.

"Okey okey, try this one." the girl continues.

A top the ruins of a demolished castle a meeting like no other is brewing. The government of the lands is to be decided here, as the old one is dead. The weather is crystal clear, and the invited VIP's are arriving in groups.

First, the people of the lake town arrive. The master, who once was the servant and the servant who was once the master take a seat at one end of the table. 

Next, the drunk travelers arrive with their old lady, the seer. Not only the seer takes a place at the table, her trusty advisor, who recognizes our heroes as the younglings he brought to these lands.

Following them are the wolves and their packleader, who transforms into a muscular man with white hair. He displayes a faint air of fear as he  sits down at the table, he was once their captive.

From afar, the mountain people have traveled. In furcoats and furhats, they present their leader, a posh but fair gentleman.

Last but not least, the ravens arrive. Their leader, a father with no remorse, cast aside his barkeeper robes to sit down at the table.

The discussions rage on for hours, but in the end a system of rotating governance is enacted, said to be fair for all parties, always determined by a vote from each tribe.

he girl grins.

"Ouch, hardball." the gnome cries out.

The girls grin stretch out even more.

"Its Jonata of Vallaki, Fiona Watcher, Madam Eva, Stranimir, packleader Kiril, I guess Dimitri Krekov, and Urwin Martikov. These are all recent memories Try this one." the gnome continues.

The two leave their path and continue far over the gravel, passing hundreds of ponds reflecting thousands of scenes.

The girl asks "Where are we going."

The gnome answers, "A dark place".

This pond takes a few seconds to settle, and even more time is required for the gods eyes to adjust, before they can spot its content. A trench bisects an enormous cavern supported by naturally formed stone columns. Stone lampposts reflect off crystals embedded in the walls and ceiling. Water drips from stalactites onto leather tarps covering clusters of merchant stalls west and east of the trench. Beyond these marketplaces are wellÂ·tended gardens of mold and fungi, crystal walkways, and stone bridges. The tranquil beauty of this place is undone by sounds of combat to the northeast, the sound of metal against stone boom throughout the cave and panicked svirfneblin run from 8-foot-tall duergar. In one of a group of drows is acquainted by a fearsome female human necromancer. She strolls into the tent and does not even flinch when she spots the maimed beholder, who's center eye and 4 of its tentacle eyestalks has been damaged. The drow leader, impressed by the ladies tenacity puts aside his discussions of the lost magical orb to talk about the location of the legendary library. Outside the other adventurers are torturing a poor gnome about the orb. The duergar are also hunting the orb, the orb is on everyone's lips, except the drow leader, and this young lady. The drow leader touches his ring, and the rest is history.

The girl laughs "My eyes were pierced on them by the time! The lady is non-other than Tara the terrible, the boss is Zentarim chief negotiator Ghazrim du Loc, the beholder is Lorthuun the maimed and the gem holds Demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu."

"Dam your good, I have a final number, let go as far back as possible, with the most obscure characters."

This strole takes the two far, the ponds here becomes fewer and fewer until only one remains. Here it lies alone, at the edge of all the pools.

A dark damp cave...
